I utilized Python and Tableau for the execution of this project.

Employing Pandas for robust data handling, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to delve into customer behavior. Through K-Means clustering, distinct customer segments emerged based on recency, frequency, and monetary metrics. The refined segmentation provided actionable insights for tailored marketing strategies, product recommendations, and loyalty programs. Utilizing Tableau for visualization, I crafted interactive dashboards that deepened the interpretation of complex patterns, facilitating data-driven decision-making. crafted with Matplotlib and Seaborn, enhanced the interpretation of complex patterns. This data-driven approach not only deepened customer understanding but also empowered strategic decisions, fostering increased customer satisfaction and revenue optimization
